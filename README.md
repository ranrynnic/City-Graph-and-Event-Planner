The Event Planner application console it’s a program that helps users to organize and manage events.
-Add an Event
-View an Event
-Delete an Event
-View All Events
-Exit
Why did you make that kind of application and how does it contribute to you or to the community?
I created the Event Planner to practice basic programming skills and understand how to manage data with a hash table. And for the community, it helps the community by providing a simple, easy-to-understand that helps people organize and manage their events more efficiently.
